This is the first in a series of topics to help Magento merchants and developers understand the implications of the California Consumer Protection Act, and to provide guidance and technical information for compliance with the legislation. 

The [California Consumer Protection Act][1]{: target="_blank"} (CCPA) expands the rights of consumers in California to determine how their personal information is collected, stored, and used, with an emphasis on protecting consumers frm the unauthorized sale or excxhange or their personal information. The regulation is expected to protect over $12 billion worth of personal information that is used in advertising within the state of California each year. The CCPA was enacted in 2018 and is expected to take effect January 1, 2020. 

At the time of this writing, the final form of the legislation is still subject to change pending scheduled [public hearings][2] and review. This content will be updated as more information becomes available. For the full text of the Senate Bill, see [SB-1121 California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018][3].

The CCPA grants the following new rights to consumers:

- **Right to know** what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold.
- **Right to delete** personal information that is held by a business and/or their service provider(s).
- **Right to opt out** of the sale of their personal information. 
- **Right to non-discrimination** in terms of price or service for having exercised a privacy right under CCPA.

In an increasingly complex landscape where regulations vary from country to country -- and sometimes within a country from state to state -- even the definition of Personal Information (PI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) can change from one regulation to the next. Under the CCPA, the definition of personal information is slightly different from what has been considered standard until now. Section 1798.140 of the CCPA defines personal information as:

  "Information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household."

This expanded definition of personal information requires merchants to know where separate pieces of data are stored in the database, with an understanding that when linked with other data, become personally identifiable. To protect consumers from the unauthorized use of their information, the CCPA requires qualified businesses to provide additional documentation and to establish new procedures for notification, opting-out, and the deletion of consumer data upon request. The CCPA also requires service providers to provide businesses that are subject to the CCPA with the technical information necessary to meet their obligations under the regulation.

## Business Requirements
 
The CCPA applies to businesses engaged in commerce activities in the State of California, and that collect personal information from California consumers. The CCPA defines a business as:

(1) A sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or other legal entity that is organized or operated for the profit or financial benefit of its shareholders or other owners, that collects consumers’ personal information, or on the behalf of which such information is collected and that alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of consumers’ personal information, that does business in the State of California, and that satisfies one or more of the following thresholds*:

- A gross annual revenue in excess of $25 million;
- Or that buy, receive, or sell the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices;
- Or that derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from the sale of consumer personal information.

* Businesses that handle the personal information of more than 4 million consumers have additional obligations under the CCPA.

(2) Any entity that controls or is controlled by a business, as defined in paragraph (1), and that shares common branding with the business. “Control” or “controlled” means ownership of, or the power to vote, more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares of any class of voting security of a business; control in any manner over the election of a majority of the directors, or of individuals exercising similar functions; or the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management of a company. “Common branding” means a shared name, servicemark, or trademark.

**If your business meets any of these requirements, follow the steps outlined in the next topic, [CCPA Compliance Guide for Magento Merchants]({% link stores/compliance-ccpa-guide-merchants.md -%}).**

And if your business is not required to comply with the CCPA, we recommend that you consider these consumer protection steps as a best practice, and become familiar with the [CCPA Compliance Guide for Magento Merchants]({% link stores/compliance-ccpa-guide-merchants.md -%}).
