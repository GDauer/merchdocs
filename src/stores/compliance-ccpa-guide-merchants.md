Measures for data governance


If your business is required to comply with the CCPA, 

If your business is required to comply with both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union and the CCPA, you can leverage the work that you completed for GDPA compliance, and make some modifications for the CCPA. 

The GDPA definition of personal information includes both public and non-public information.
CCPA has additional data inventory and mapping requirements
The CPPA has different privacy policy requirements

1.  Take inventory of your digital properties and all third-party integrations and third parties that have access to your customer data.
   
    - Determine what personal information is being collected through your website(s) and mobile application(s). This data might reside in cookies, tags, and other technologies that are used to collect information. 
    - Identify the parties with whom you share data, and divide them into the following groups:
  
      **Service Providers**:  Those who provide services on your behalf. For example, Adobe is service provider, as are the developers of any Magento extensions or analytics software to whom customer data might be disclosed for a business purpose. 
      
      **Other Third Parties**: Those with whom you share or sell customer data.  For example, you might share customer data with an advertising network in exchange for advertising.

1.  Review your agreements with service providers.Ccondra
   
    Update service provider contracts to reflect CCPA requirements.

1.  Map your customer journey.

    Identify each touchpoint where personal information is collected during your customer's path to purchase in your store(s).  Visitors to your site must be notified before, or at the point of each data collection.
   

 
1.  ** Establish procedures to respond to customer requests to know, opt-out, and delete. 
    Develop a mechanism to inform customers of any existing arrangements to sell their personal information, and that processes customer requests to opt-out.

    **User-Enabled Privacy Settings**
    User-enabled privacy settings that signal a choice to opt out are considered to be valid opt-out requests.
    
   
    **Do Not Sell My Info**: For opt-out requests, businesses must provide a "Do Not Sell My Info" link on their website or mobile app.

  **Age of Consent**: 

  A business that exclusively targets consumers under 16 years of age and does not sell their personal information without permission is not required to provide a notice to opt-out.

  **Minors < 13**: Parental authorization is required for minors under the age of 13 to opt-in to the sale of their personal information.

  **Minors 13 to < 16**: Minors at least 13 and less than 16 years of age can opt-in to the sale of their personal information, provided the business establishes a reasonable process to document the action. The process must be set forth in the company's [privacy policy]({% link stores/privacy-policy.md -%}). When a business receives a request from such a minor, it must inform the minor to their right to opt-out at a later date, and explain how to do it.

1.  Update your privacy policy to inform customers how their data is used.

  Update and expand your current privacy policy as defined by the [California Online Privacy Protection Policy][1] (CalOPPA) 
  
  As a merchant, you must disclose any financial incentives offered in exchange for the retention or sale of consumer personal information. You must explain how the incentive is allowed under CCPA, and how the value is calculated.

    **Use of Personal Information**
   
    **Age of Consent to Opt In**


1.  Create procedures to manage and fulfill requests to delete data.
   
   You must verify the identity of people who request to know, opt-out, or delete, regardless of whether they have a password-protected account, or are visiting your store as a guest.

    You must respond to requests from consumers to know, opt out, and delete within a specific (as yet undefined) time frames.

    To demonstrate compliance, you must maintain records of consumer requests and your response for a period of 24 months.
    
    Businesses that collect, buy, or sell personal information of more than 4 million consumers have additional record-keeping and training requirements.
